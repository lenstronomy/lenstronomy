    """
    Cosmic string profile, where the string is a straight 1d topological defect.
    Local metric of string is flat, but global spacetime is conical.
    This results in the total radians around a string being 2π - ∆ø, where ∆ø is the deficit angle.
    ∆ø = 8πGµ/c^2, where µ is the linear density in kg/m.
    The string deflects light from a source by the constant angle 4πGµ, resulting in two images with 0 magnification or shear.
    This model is simplified such that the string is completely flat on image plane (no rotation towards/away from observer) and it is currently of infinite length.
