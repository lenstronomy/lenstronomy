========
Usage
========

To use lenstronomy in a project::

	import lenstronomy

Getting started
---------------

The `starting guide jupyter notebook <https://github.com/lenstronomy/lenstronomy-tutorials/blob/main/Notebooks/GettingStarted/starting_guide.ipynb>`_
leads through the main modules and design features of ``lenstronomy``. The modular design of ``lenstronomy`` allows the
user to directly access a lot of tools and each module can also be used as stand-alone packages.


Example notebooks
-----------------

We have made an extension module available at `https://github.com/lenstronomy/lenstronom-tutorials <https://github.com/lenstronomy/lenstronom-tutorials/>`_.
You can find simple example notebooks for various cases. The latest versions of the notebooks should be compatible with the recent pip version of lenstronomy.
