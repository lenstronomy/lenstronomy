# conf_default.yaml file for lenstronomy configurations

numba:

  enable: True  # if False, does ignore all numba functionalities
  nopython: True  # see numba jit
  cache: True  # see numba jit
  parallel: False  # see numba jit
  error_model: 'numpy' # This avoids ZeroDivisionErrors and instead makes numba return nans (with a one-time warning)
  fastmath: False # Disabled by default because it changes nans to poison values which could lead to incorrect results
                  # for functions that can return nans, but useful for some functions.

conventions:

  sersic_major_axis: False  # if True, defines the half-light radius of the Sersic light profile along the semi-major axis (which is the Galfit convention)
                            # if False, uses the product average of semi-major and semi-minor axis as the convention (default definition for all light profiles in lenstronomy other than the Sersic profile)
