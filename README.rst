``lenstronomy`` is a multi-purpose software package to model strong gravitational lenses.
``lenstronomy`` finds application for time-delay cosmography and measuring
the expansion rate of the Universe, for quantifying lensing substructure to infer dark matter properties, morphological quantification of galaxies,
quasar-host galaxy decomposition and much more.
A (incomplete) list of publications making use of lenstronomy can be found `at this link <https://github.com/lenstronomy/lenstronomy/blob/main/PUBLISHED.rst>`_.


The development is coordinated on `GitHub <https://github.com/lenstronomy/lenstronomy>`_ and contributions are welcome.
The documentation of ``lenstronomy`` is available at `readthedocs.org <http://lenstronomy.readthedocs.org/>`_ and
the package is distributed through PyPI_ and conda-forge_.
``lenstronomy`` is an `affiliated package <https://www.astropy.org/affiliated/>`_ of `astropy <https://www.astropy.org/>`_.



Installation
------------

|PyPI| |conda-forge|

lenstronomy releases are distributed through PyPI_ and conda-forge_. Instructions for
installing lenstronomy and its dependencies can be found in the Installation_
section of the documentation.
Specific instructions for settings and installation requirements for special cases that can provide speed-ups,
we also refer to the Installation_ page.

Getting started
---------------

The `starting guide jupyter notebook <https://github.com/lenstronomy/lenstronomy-tutorials/blob/main/Notebooks/GettingStarted/starting_guide.ipynb>`_
leads through the main modules and design features of ``lenstronomy``. The modular design of ``lenstronomy`` allows the
user to directly access a lot of tools and each module can also be used as stand-alone packages.

If you are new to gravitational lensing, check out the `mini lecture series <https://github.com/sibirrer/strong_lensing_lectures>`_ giving an introduction to gravitational lensing
with interactive Jupyter notebooks in the cloud.



Example notebooks
-----------------

We have made an extension module available at `https://github.com/lenstronomy/lenstronomy-tutorials <https://github.com/lenstronomy/lenstronomy-tutorials>`_.
You can find simple example notebooks for various cases. The latest versions of the notebooks should be compatible with the recent pip version of lenstronomy.



Affiliated packages
-------------------
Multiple affiliated packages that make use of lenstronomy can be found `here <https://lenstronomy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/affiliatedpackages.html>`_
(not complete) and further packages are under development by the community.


Mailing list and Slack channel
------------------------------

You can join the ``lenstronomy`` mailing list by signing up on the
`google groups page <https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/lenstronomy>`_.


The email list is meant to provide a communication platform between users and developers. You can ask questions,
and suggest new features. New releases will be announced via this mailing list.

We also have a `Slack channel <https://lenstronomers.slack.com>`_ for the community.
Please send us an `email <lenstronomy-dev@googlegroups.com>`_ such that we can add you to the channel.


If you encounter errors or problems with ``lenstronomy``, please let us know!
