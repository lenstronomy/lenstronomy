        This package is designed to model strong lens systems.
        The software is based on Birrer et al 2015, http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2015ApJ...813..102B and finds application in
        e.g. Birrer et al. 2016 for time-delay cosmography and Birrer et al. 2017 for lensing substructure analysis.
        
        
        The development is coordinated on `GitHub <http://github.com/sibirrer/lenstronomy>`_ and contributions are welcome.
        The documentation of **lenstronomy** is available at `readthedocs.org <http://lenstronomy.readthedocs.org/>`_
        
        
        
        Installation
        --------
        * check out the github repository
        >>> cd lenstronomy
        >>> python setup.py install
        or in development mode
        >>> python setup.py develop
        * it is recommended to check out and install the dependency fastell4py independently.
        * run the test functions to see whether the installation was successful.
        >>> cd lenstronomy
        >>> py.test
        
        
        Requirements
        -------
        * to run the lens models from Barkana (fastell), also requires githug/sibirrer/fastell4py (needs a fortran compiler)
        * CosmoHammer (through PyPi)
        * standard python libraries (numpy, scipy)
        
        
        Bug reporting and contributions
        -------
        * see CONTRIBUTING.rst
        * you can also directly contact the lead developer, Simon Birrer
        
        Modelling Features
        --------
        
        * Extended source reconstruction with basis sets (shapelets)
        * Analytic light profiles for lens and source as options
        * Point sources (including solving the lens equation)
        * a variety of mass models to use
        * non-linear line-of-sight description
        * iterative point spread function
        * linear and non-linear optimization modules
        
        
        
        Analysis tools
        -------
        * Standardized fitting procedures for some lens systems
        * Modular build up to design plugins by users
        * Interactive jupyter notebooks
        * Pre-defined plotting and illustration routines
        * Particle swarm optimization for parameter fitting
        * MCMC (emcee from CosmoHammer) for parameter inferences
        * Kinematic modelling
        * Cosmographic inference tools
